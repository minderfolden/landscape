**Problem**
Lurkers. They join the group, watch, but never contribute to the experience.

**Proposed Solution**
Have some kind of "Most recent engagement was X days ago" monitor. Then I could have a better idea of who the lurkers are.

**Possible Alternatives**
Auto deduct BTC from the ship's wallet if no engagement over X duration.

**Additional context**
I'm partly kidding, but mostly serious.
